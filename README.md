## Recent Work

**O1 - Cloud DevOps Orchestration Platform** (SaaS)  
Built a multi-cloud orchestration platform managing infrastructure across AWS, Azure, GCP, and DigitalOcean. Implemented real-time SSH connections, Ansible automation, and Redis-backed task queuing with Socket.IO for live status updates.

**Multi-Tenant SaaS Products**  
Architected and deployed three production SaaS platforms (Shift Management, Sales Software, LMS) using Turborepo for monorepo management, isolated PostgreSQL schemas per tenant, and Redis for session/cache optimization.

**AI-Powered Applications**  
Integrated OpenAI and Anthropic models with recursive function calling, feature flags, and multi-model orchestration. Built token counting for cost tracking and optimized prompt handling for production AI workflows.

**Payment & Finance Automation**  
Implemented Stripe Connect for marketplace payments, subscription billing, and escrow systems. Developed OCR-based receipt scanning with AI-driven compliance checks for corporate expense management (PayNest).

**Enterprise Deployments**  
Managed production infrastructure on AWS EC2, Azure AKS clusters, and VPS environments. Configured CI/CD pipelines, domain linking, environment management, and monitoring solutions using journalctl and healthchecks.
