# Hi, I'm Akif Nadeem 👋

**Software Engineer specializing in production SaaS platforms, payment systems, and multi-tenant architecture.**

4+ years building scalable systems that handle real users, real transactions, and real infrastructure challenges. From multi-cloud orchestration to Stripe payment processing, I architect solutions that don't break at 3 AM.

Currently: Building a **Recruitment Management System** with workflow automation and integrated payment processing.

## Specializations

**SaaS Architecture & Multi-Tenancy**
Building production platforms with isolated tenant data, scalable monorepo structures (Turborepo), and Redis-backed caching strategies. Experience architecting systems that serve multiple companies from a single codebase while maintaining data isolation and performance.

**Payment Systems Integration**
Deep expertise in Stripe Connect for marketplace platforms, subscription billing, escrow systems, and automated payouts. Implemented payment flows handling real transactions with PCI compliance and fraud prevention considerations.

**Production Infrastructure**
Managing multi-cloud deployments across AWS, Azure, GCP, and DigitalOcean. Experience with Docker containerization, Ansible automation, CI/CD pipelines, and zero-downtime deployment strategies for production systems.

**Real-Time Systems**
Building WebSocket-based applications with Socket.IO for live updates, notifications, and real-time collaboration features. Redis pub/sub for distributed system communication.

## Recent Projects

### O1 - Multi-Cloud Orchestration Platform

**Challenge**: DevOps teams needed a unified interface to manage infrastructure across AWS, Azure, GCP, and DigitalOcean without context-switching between provider dashboards.

**Solution**: Built a SaaS platform with real-time SSH connections via WebSockets, Redis-backed task queuing for asynchronous operations, and Ansible automation for deployment orchestration.

**Tech**: Node.js, Socket.IO, Redis, Ansible, Multi-cloud APIs
**Impact**: Centralized infrastructure management with live status updates and automated deployment workflows.

---

### Multi-Tenant SaaS Platforms

**Challenge**: Build three separate production SaaS products (Shift Management, Sales Software, LMS) with shared infrastructure but complete data isolation.

**Solution**: Architected a Turborepo monorepo structure with isolated PostgreSQL schemas per tenant, shared component libraries, and Redis for session management and caching optimization.

**Tech**: TypeScript, React, Next.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, Turborepo
**Impact**: Three production platforms serving multiple companies with optimized code sharing and zero cross-tenant data leakage.

---

### Payment & Marketplace Systems

**Challenge**: Enable marketplace platform to handle vendor payouts, subscription billing, and escrow transactions while maintaining PCI compliance.

**Solution**: Implemented Stripe Connect for split payments and marketplace operations, subscription billing with automated invoicing, and escrow systems for secure transaction handling. Built OCR-based receipt scanning with AI-driven compliance validation for corporate expense management.

**Tech**: Stripe (Connect, Subscriptions), Node.js, OpenAI, React
**Impact**: Production payment flows handling real transactions with automated compliance checks.

---

### AI-Powered Applications

**Challenge**: Integrate multiple AI models into production applications with cost optimization and reliability requirements.

**Solution**: Built multi-model orchestration system supporting OpenAI and Anthropic (Claude) with recursive function calling, feature flags for gradual rollouts, and token counting for cost tracking. Implemented prompt optimization strategies for production AI workflows.

**Tech**: OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Node.js, React
**Impact**: Production AI features with cost controls and fallback handling for reliability.

## What I'm Working On

**Infrastructure Automation**: Deepening expertise in Ansible for configuration management, Linux system administration, and building robust observability solutions for production systems.

**Advanced TypeScript Patterns**: Exploring type-safe architectures, advanced generics, and patterns for large-scale TypeScript applications.

**Distributed Systems**: Advanced Redis use cases for caching strategies, pub/sub patterns, and distributed locking mechanisms.

---

## Open For

**Contract/Consulting**: Complex backend architecture, payment system integrations, multi-tenant SaaS implementations
**Interesting Problems**: Scaling challenges, real-time systems, production infrastructure automation

**Best fit for**:
- Startups needing solid SaaS architecture from the ground up
- Fintech companies requiring payment integration (Stripe Connect, subscriptions, escrow)
- Companies scaling beyond MVP with multi-tenancy requirements
- Production systems needing infrastructure automation and monitoring
