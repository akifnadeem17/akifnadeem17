# 👋 Hi, I'm Muhammad Akif

🌍 **Based in Lahore, Pakistan** | 💼 **Senior Software Engineer**

---

## 🧩 Professional Summary

I build **production infrastructure platforms and AI-enabled SaaS products that scale**—from multi-cloud deployment systems managing hundreds of nodes to recruitment platforms processing thousands of candidates monthly. With **4+ years of shipping real products**, I specialize in payment-heavy systems, infrastructure automation, and full-stack development where reliability and maintainability matter.

I work close to both product and infrastructure—designing APIs, integrating payment systems like Stripe, automating cloud deployments, and building features that teams confidently run in production.

## 🔑 Core Expertise

* **Full‑stack SaaS development** with React, Next.js, Node.js, and TypeScript
* **Payment infrastructure**: Stripe (Subscriptions, Connect, complex billing), Razorpay
* **Backend engineering**: API design, real-time systems, business logic
* **AI‑enabled features** using OpenAI & Anthropic APIs
* **Infrastructure automation**: Docker, Ansible, CI/CD, multi-cloud orchestration
* **Cloud platforms**: AWS, Azure, DigitalOcean

## 🏗️ Featured Projects

### **O1 – Open Infrastructure & Operations Platform**

A production-ready infrastructure management platform providing a **unified control plane for deploying and operating applications across AWS, Azure, GCP, DigitalOcean, and on-prem servers**.

**The Challenge:**  
Teams needed a single interface to manage multi-cloud infrastructure without vendor lock-in, support both containerized and traditional deployments, and automate provisioning at scale.

**What I Built:**
* Web-based platform for multi-cloud node management with **real-time metrics and log streaming**
* Dual deployment model: **Docker containers or systemd services** on the same infrastructure
* Application catalog with pre-configured services (PostgreSQL, blockchain nodes, monitoring stacks)
* **Ansible-powered automation** for zero-touch provisioning and orchestration
* Ethereum-based authentication (SIWE) with role-based access control
* Chrome extension for browser-based infrastructure monitoring

**Tech Stack:** TypeScript monorepo, React, Node.js/Express, WebSockets, Ansible, Docker, AWS/Azure/GCP SDKs, PostgreSQL

### **Recruitment Management System (Recruitment CRM)**

A full-stack recruitment CRM built for modern recruitment agencies, supporting the **complete hiring lifecycle** with real-time collaboration, advanced search, and analytics.

**The Challenge:**  
Recruitment agencies needed to manage thousands of candidates, track complex pipelines, coordinate team workflows, and maintain client relationships—all in one system with powerful search capabilities.

**What I Built:**
* Comprehensive candidate, client, and job management with **structured workflow automation**
* Multi-stage recruitment pipeline with interview scheduling and placement tracking
* Financial tracking and commission management for successful placements
* **AI-powered semantic search** using Meilisearch + OpenAI embeddings
* Real-time notifications and activity streams via **Socket.io**
* Advanced analytics dashboards showing pipeline health, conversion rates, and team performance
* Role-based access control for agencies with multiple teams

**Tech Stack:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL (Supabase), Prisma, Meilisearch, OpenAI, Socket.io, Tailwind CSS

## 🚀 What I'm Looking For

I'm interested in **senior engineering roles** or **founding engineer positions** at product-focused companies where I can:

* Own payment infrastructure and billing systems end-to-end
* Build and scale multi-tenant SaaS platforms from early stages
* Work directly with founders/leadership on technical architecture
* Solve complex integration challenges across third-party APIs

**Ideal company profile:** Early-stage B2B SaaS (Seed to Series A), 5-30 person team, strong product-market fit, ambitious technical challenges in payments, infrastructure, or AI-enabled products.

**Also open to:** Long-term contract work on payment-heavy systems, fintech platforms, or infrastructure automation projects.

## 🎯 Development Philosophy

I believe great engineering isn't just about writing code—it's about **understanding the business problem, choosing the right tools, and building systems that teams can maintain**. I prioritize:

* **Security & reliability** – Proper error handling, monitoring, and incident response
* **Developer experience** – Clear documentation, sensible abstractions, debuggable systems
* **Long-term thinking** – Architectural decisions that scale with the product
* **Shipping iteratively** – Get to production fast, then improve based on real usage
